Hello everyone! I am back again with some of the most asked interview questions out there in the industry right now. It is the Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock series. There are a total of 4 questions based on the same idea of buying and selling stock. We will solve them all one by one.

Let jump into it!
<br/><br/>

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - I
-------------------------------------

### Problem Statement
-------------------------------------
Say you have an array for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
