This is the first thing that most entities on the internet start with. The Hello World. So here I am, bidding hello to the world and to you.

Viraj Mavani. This is how people know me. An Average Joe. The Muhammed Lee. A student at L. D. College of Engineering pursuing his interests in the bold and huge field of Electronics. As I mentioned, an Average Joe means an average student too. The seven point someone guy. I live in Ahmedabad and roam about just a little even though I want to. When it comes to attending classes, I am regularly irregular. The story of every to-be-engineer.

Apart from being common, I also happen to be an Editor for the College Magazine and that is not so common among the ‚ÄòHouse of Commons‚Äô (literally). The magazine goes by the name Vox Populi (Check it out on FB). I am also a regular quizzer and an occasional Quiz Master for the quizzing club of the college under the name Mind Palace. A free lance photographer too. The blog background you see is credited to me. So, that‚Äôs where I am at present, leading a common happening life ;). (That was all too common-common :P)

Thus, the purpose is defined. I will be updating my experiences with the Magazine, the Quiz Club and the Photography. I may go out of the line sometimes and get some creative. You will come to know it then. üòâ

So here I am, signing off with a sentence that I adore a lot.

‚ÄúI solemnly swear that I am up to no good.‚Äù

Later.
